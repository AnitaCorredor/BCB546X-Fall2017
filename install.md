## Unix

In order to complete computational exercises and the group project for this course, students will need access to a Unix operating system, which is the core for Mac OS X and Linux operating systems.

### Windows Users

A Unix environment can be emulated using the “​Git Bash​” program, by partitioning your hard drive and installing U​buntu (a free version of Linux),​ or by installing Cygwin​. These solutions for PC users may not be ideal for all course exercises and we can provide access to Mac computers if you would prefer to go this route.
